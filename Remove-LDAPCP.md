# How to remove LDAPCP

## Reset property ClaimProviderName in the SPTrustedIdentityTokenIssuer

Unfortunately, the only supported way to reset property ClaimProviderName is to remove and recreate the SPTrustedIdentityTokenIssuer object, which requires to remove the trust from all the zones where it is used first, which is time consuming.

Alternatively, it's possible to use reflection to reset this property, but it is not supported and you do this at your own risks. Here is the script:

```powershell
$trust = Get-SPTrustedIdentityTokenIssuer "SPTRUST NAME"
$trust.GetType().GetField("m_ClaimProviderName", "NonPublic, Instance").SetValue($trust, $null)
$trust.Update()
```

## Uninstall LDAPCP

Randomly, SharePoint doesnâ€™t uninstall the solution correctly: it removes the assembly too early and fails to call the feature receiver... When this happens, the claims provider is not removed and that causes issues when you re-install it.

To uninstall safely, **deactivate the farm feature before retracting the solution**:

```powershell
# Run this on a new PowerShell console (it tends to avoid issues with local cache of persisted objects, that could cause errors on such operations)
Disable-SPFeature -identity "LDAPCP"
Uninstall-SPSolution -Identity "LDAPCP.wsp"
# Wait for the timer job to complete
Remove-SPSolution -Identity "LDAPCP.wsp"
```

Validate that claims provider was removed:

```powershell
Get-SPClaimProvider| ft DisplayName
# If LDAPCP appears in cmdlet above, remove it:
Remove-SPClaimProvider LDAPCP
```
